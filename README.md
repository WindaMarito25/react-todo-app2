## Getting Started

To embark on your journey with Project To-Do App, follow these detailed instructions to set up and run the application on your local machine:


### 1. Clone the repository

Begin by cloning the project's repository to your local directory using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<project_name>.git
```

Replace `<your_username>` with your actual GitHub username and `<project_name>` with the name of your Mini Project To-Do repository.

This command will create a copy of the project's codebase on your computer, allowing you to access and modify the files.

### 2.  Install dependencies

Once you've successfully cloned the repository, navigate into the project directory using the following command:

```
cd <project_name>
```
Replace `<project_name>` with the actual name of your project directory.

Within the project directory, execute the following command to install all the necessary dependencies required for the application to run:

```
npm install
```

This command utilizes the Node Package Manager (npm) to download and install all the JavaScript libraries and tools specified in the project's `package.json` file.

### 3.  Run the application:

With the dependencies in place, you're now ready to launch the Mini Project To-Do application. To do so, execute the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This command will start the development server, which will compile the React code and render the application in your default web browser. You should be able to view the application running at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before proceeding. You can download and install them from their official websites.
- If you encounter any issues during the installation or running process, refer to the project's documentation or seek assistance from the community.
